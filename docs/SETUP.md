# e3d-brain Setup

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22 (see `.nvmrc`). macOS (arm64) or Linux (x64/arm64).
- Obsidian is optional; `ebrain` only reads and writes plain Markdown.

## Install

The only install procedure (I9):

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build:native   # the single native-build step: npm rebuild better-sqlite3
npm run build
```

`npm run build:native` is needed only if `ebrain doctor` reports that
`better-sqlite3` failed to load (it ships prebuilt binaries for common
platforms).

Then run `node dist/src/cli/main.js` (or `ebrain` once linked or installed).

```bash
ebrain --version
ebrain doctor
```

## Configuration

Default location: `~/.e3d-brain/config.json`. Override with the
`EBRAIN_CONFIG` environment variable (absolute path, or starting with `~/`).

The file must be owned by you and not group- or world-writable
(`chmod 600 ~/.e3d-brain/config.json`); otherwise loading fails. It may not be
a symlink into another directory.

```json
{
  "vaultPath": "/abs/path/to/vault",
  "stateDir": "~/.e3d-brain",
  "principal": { "id": "chris", "type": "human" },
  "mode": "inbox",
  "limits": { "maxCharsPerCall": 10000 },
  "network": { "allowedHosts": [] },
  "scrub": { "extraPatterns": [] },
  "embeddings": { "provider": "none" }
}
```

Unknown keys at any level are errors, as are wrong types and `null` values.
Optional keys may be omitted to take their defaults.

| Key | Required | Default | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vaultPath` | yes | | absolute path, or starts with `~/` (only that prefix is expanded; no environment variables) |
| `stateDir` | no | `~/.e3d-brain` | same path rules; must not be inside the vault or contain it; created `0700` |
| `principal.id` | yes | | `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$` (used as a path segment) |
| `principal.type` | yes | | `human` or `agent` |
| `mode` | yes | | `inbox`, `journal`, or `read-only`; `journal` requires `principal.type: agent` |
| `limits.maxCharsPerCall` | no | `10000` | integer 1-10000; can only lower the built-in ceiling |
| `network.allowedHosts` | no | `[]` | lowercase hostnames (no scheme, port, or wildcard); empty means no network |
| `scrub.extraPatterns` | no | `[]` | non-empty strings (regular expressions, used by the scrubber in Phase 7) |
| `embeddings.provider` | no | `none` | `none` (other providers are added in Phase 12) |

Later phases add keys here in the same change that adds them to the schema.

## State directory

`stateDir` holds derived and private data (index, audit log). It is created
with mode `0700`; files the tool creates are `0600`. It is never synced
between machines and never placed inside the vault.

## Vault versioning

Keeping the vault in `git` is recommended for diffing and rolling back what an
agent recorded. `ebrain` never runs git itself.
